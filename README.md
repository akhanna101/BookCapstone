# BookCapstone

For this project, I was working with information from 100k books, scraped from goodreads. 
The data can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/mdhamani/goodreads-books-100k

In the first part of this analysis, I generated a word cloud of the genres of the books present in the dataset.

For the second part of this analysis, I wanted to see if the gender identity of the subject or author was related to the rating score.
